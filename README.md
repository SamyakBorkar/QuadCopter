# Quadcopter Project 

Welcome to the Quadcopter Project! This project involves building a custom quadcopter without a traditional flight controller. Instead, we use an ESP microcontroller with an MPU-6050 sensor for flight stabilization, along with ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers), BLDC (Brushless DC) motors, an RF receiver, and a FlySky transmitter for control. Let's dive into the details!

## Project Components 🔧

Here is a breakdown of the components used in this project:

- **ESP Microcontroller**: The brain 🧠 of the quadcopter. Responsible for processing sensor data and controlling the ESCs.
- **MPU-6050**: An accelerometer and gyroscope sensor for orientation and motion data.
- **ESCs**: Electronic Speed Controllers to manage the speed and direction of the BLDC motors.
- **BLDC Motors**: The quadcopter's propulsion system.
- **RF Receiver**: Receives signals from the FlySky transmitter.
- **FlySky Transmitter**: A remote control for the quadcopter. 📡
- **Battery**: A LiPo (Lithium Polymer) battery to power the entire system. 🔋
- **Frame**: The structural frame that holds all the components together. 🏗️
- **Propellers**: Attached to the motors for lift and maneuverability. 🌀

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Experience with Arduino IDE or similar development environments.
- Basic electronics knowledge (soldering, wiring, etc.).
- Understanding of quadcopter dynamics and flight control principles.
- Required components (see above).

### Assembly Instructions 🔩

1. **Build the Frame**: Assemble or construct a suitable frame for the quadcopter. Ensure it has mounting points for the motors, ESCs, and other components.

2. **Install the Motors and ESCs**: Mount the BLDC motors onto the frame and connect them to their respective ESCs. Ensure proper connections for power and signal. ⚡

3. **Connect the MPU-6050**: Wire the MPU-6050 to the ESP microcontroller. Typically, this involves using I2C connections.

4. **Set Up the RF Receiver**: Connect the RF receiver to the ESP microcontroller. Ensure that it communicates with the FlySky transmitter.

5. **Install the Battery**: Mount the battery securely on the frame and connect it to the power distribution system.

6. **Programming the ESP**: Write or upload the code to the ESP microcontroller. This code should handle sensor data processing, motor control, and communication with the RF receiver.

7. **Testing and Calibration**: Once everything is assembled, test the quadcopter on the ground to ensure all components are working correctly. Calibrate the MPU-6050 for accurate sensor readings. 📐

### Flight Control Code 💻

The ESP microcontroller code should include:

- **Sensor Reading**: Read data from the MPU-6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope).
- **Signal Processing**: Apply filters or algorithms to the sensor data for stability. The code can use PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) or Kalman filter for stabilization.
- **Motor Control**: Calculate the necessary motor speeds for maintaining stability and responding to the FlySky transmitter inputs.
- **Communication Handling**: Process input signals from the RF receiver and convert them into motor control commands.

### Safety Precautions ⚠️

- Always test the quadcopter in an open area to avoid collisions or damage.
- Use propeller guards to reduce the risk of injury. 🛡️
- Ensure the battery is properly charged and maintained.
- Follow all safety guidelines for soldering and electronics handling.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

Here are some common issues and their potential solutions:

- **Quadcopter is Unstable**: Check MPU-6050 calibration and ensure motor/ESC connections are correct.
- **No Signal from Transmitter**: Verify RF receiver connections and ensure the transmitter is correctly paired.
- **ESP Not Responding**: Re-flash the code and check for wiring issues.
